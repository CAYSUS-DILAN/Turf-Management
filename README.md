# Turf-Management
This project dives into the world of turfgrass management, utilizing a Database Management System (DBMS) to streamline care and cultivate a thriving lawn.  The database will store crucial information like grass type, soil conditions, watering schedules, and fertilization plans
Imagine a database system designed specifically to manage all aspects of keeping your lawn lush and healthy. This Turfgrass Management system would be a haven for homeowners and professionals alike. It could store information on grass varieties, soil conditions, fertilization schedules, and irrigation plans. Users could track pest and disease outbreaks, monitor weather patterns, and receive customized recommendations for maintaining a beautiful lawn. This project would explore the design and development of such a database system, making lawn care more efficient and effective.
